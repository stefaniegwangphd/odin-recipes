    <h1>Grandpa Joe's Favorite Braised Red Cabbage</h1>
    This is an excellent side dish for large holiday gatherings or a nice Sunday dinner. THe leftovers keep well for up to a week in the fridge. If you use apples that are naturally sweeter, you get a mostly sweet and savory dish. The sweetness of the apples will override the tartness of the apple cider vinegar.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head of red cabbage (roughly 6 cups chopped)</li>
        <li>1 large apple. sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vingear</li>
        <li>3 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Add all ingredients to a heavy bottomed pot. A 5 quart Dutch oven is recommended. </li>
        <li>Cover and cook on medium heat until the liquid starts to simmer. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer for 90 minutes, stirring every 10-15 minutes to ensure even cooking.</li>

    </ol>

<h3> Substitution notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Balsamic vinegar can be used in place of apple cider vinegar. THe vinegar flavor will be more forward in the final dish.</li>
    <li>If you love garlic, obviously add more garlic!</li>
    <li>I prefer adding freshly ground black pepper at the end to taste, otherwise the flavor gets a bit lost during the cooking.</li>
</ul>
