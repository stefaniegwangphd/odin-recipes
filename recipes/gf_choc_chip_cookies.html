<h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
This is a simple start-to-finish 30 minute recipe. Since this recipe uses melted butter, there's no planning required. If you have a craving for chocolate chip cookies, you can be snacking in 30 minutes!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup total of brown sugar and white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>4/3 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose gluten-free flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust two oven racks to the center. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Melt butter on stovetop on medium low heat. Accidental browning is okay.</li>
        <li>Use a 2/3 cup measuring cup and lighly pack with brown sugar and fill the rest with white sugar. If you prefer chewier cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar (recommended ratio 2:1 brown to white). If you prefer a balance, use a 1:1 ratio.</li>
        <li>Combine melted butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a bowl. Mix until sugar is fully saturated. The mixture should have the consistency of wet sand. You should not see any butter sitting on top of the sugar. When you drizzle it, the mixture should almost make fat ribbons.</li>
        <li>Add in the egg and mix until just combined. Let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix all dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>When the wet mixture is set, gently stir in dry ingredients until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips and let it rest another 5 minutes. Longer is better. Baking too soon will cause butter to ooze out of the cookings whilst baking.</li>
        <li>When the dough is set enough to hold together in your hand, form into small balls and place 2.5-3 inches apart on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. You can make 16 larger cookies or 30 mini cookies. Whatever floats your boat.</li>
        <li>No need to flatten cookies. Bake for 7 minutes and then rotate pans. Turn the pans 180 degrees as well. Bake for another 7-10 minutes until the edges are golden brown and crisp.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Dietary Accommodations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gluten-free</li>
        <li>If you are nut-free, swap out almond flour for gluten-free all-purpose flour. A good brand is Bob's Red Mill.</li>
    </ul>
