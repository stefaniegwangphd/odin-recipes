    <h1>Ben's favorite fried rice</h1>

This is Ben's favorite fried rice. It's one of his favorite dishes that I make and it's insultingly easy to cook. But the stomach wants what it wants, right? It's hearty, comforting, and whips up quickly on a weeknight.

<br>
There are no exact proportions, as this is meant to be a flexible recipe to use whatever vegetables you have on hand. Approximate proportions are given to give you a sense of how to adjust the recipe based on what's in your fridge and pantry! I've written this recipe based on what I typically used with summer garden ingredients.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 tbsp of neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola</li>
        <li>4-6 eggs</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, diced into 1 cm cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup to 1 cup green beans, ends picked off and sliced into 1-2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>12 oz Impossible Meat</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini, diced into 1 cm cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>3-4 cups cooked leftover rice</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a large wok on high heat until screaming hot. When you flick water drops into the wok, they should evaporate immediately. While the wok is preheating, beat the eggs and lightly season with salt.</li>
        <li>Once the wok is ready, add in 2 tbsp of oil. Swirl the oil around the wok to coat the bottom portion. When the oil on the bottom starts to bubble, add in the eggs.</li>
        <li>Quickly scramble the eggs and promptly transfer them to a bowl. Set this aside for later.</li>
        <li>If you preheated your wok right, there should be no egg residue in the wok. Add in 1 tbsp oil and bring the wok up to temp.</li>
        <li>Add in carrots and sautee until it's nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add in green beans and sautee for 2-3 minutes if using fresh and tender beans. </li>
        <li>Remove vegetables and set aside. Add in remaining oil. Sautee impossible meat until 80% cooked through. Add cubed zucchini and sautee for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add cooked carrots and green beans, frozen corn, and rice. Break up the rice so that no large clumps remain. Drizzle in both soy sauces and stir fry until the color is well distributed.</li>
        <li>Add in sesame oil and scrambled eggs. If you want a darker color for the fried rice, add dark soy sauce until desired color is attained. Otherwise, add salt and light soy sauce to taste. </li>
    </ol>

<h3>Substitution notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you follow a gluten-free diet, simply swap out the light and dark soy sauce for a gluten-free soy sauce. Add salt to taste. Your final dish will not have a rich brown color, but it'll still be tasty nonetheless!</li>
    <li>We follow a vegetarian or plant-based diet when possible. If you prefer to use meat or seafood instead of Impossible Meat, cook the meat in the wok right after the eggs and remove. Add it back in with the eggs later on.</li>
    <li>If you have a frozen vegetable medley, go ahead and use that if you're short on time.</li>
    <li>If you're using Gardein Meatless Crumbles instead of Impossible Meat, add in the crumbles with the corn.</li>
    <li>Freshly cooked rice is fine, but is often stickier. It's best to use leftover rice that's had a bit of time to dry out in the fridge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dietary accommodations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>plant-based, just omit scrambled eggs</li>
        <li>can be made gluten-free</li>
        <li>can be made with meat or seafood</li>
    </ul>
